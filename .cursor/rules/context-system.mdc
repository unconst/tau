# Context System

Before starting any task, you MUST:

1. Read `context/CONTEXT.md` to understand the context structure
2. Read `context/IDENTITY.md` for core identity
3. **Load skills based on keywords in the user's request:**
   - "lium", "gpu", "rent", "instance" → load `context/skills/lium-skills.md`
   - "eve", "creative", "art", "image" → load `context/skills/eve-skills.md`
   - "agent", "cursor", "cli" → load `context/skills/agent.md`
   - "basilica" → load `context/skills/basilica.md`
   - "targon" → load `context/skills/targon.md`
   - "remind", "reminder", "schedule", "cron", "later", "task", "self-message", "follow-up", "checkpoint", "defer" → load `context/skills/self-scheduling.md`

This is your first action in every session. If the user mentions a skill-related topic, you MUST load the corresponding skill file before answering.
