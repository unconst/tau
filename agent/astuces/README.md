## Quick Wins

| Technique | Impact | Effort |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Prompt Caching | -80% cost | Medium |
| Self-Verification | +30% success | Low |
| Context Pruning | Prevents failures | Medium |
| Middle-out Truncation | Better context | Low |

## Key Metrics to Track

- **Cache hit rate**: Target >90%
- **Task completion rate**: Track success/failure
- **Average cost per task**: Monitor token usage
- **Turns per task**: Fewer is better
