# Chat Summary

<!-- This file is automatically updated hourly by Tau to summarize the full conversation history. -->
<!-- It provides context to all agent calls so they understand the conversation without reading the full history. -->

## Summary

**System Context:**
- Docker container `a3dc454e3157` (IP: 172.24.0.2), Linux Ubuntu, 8x NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs (49GB each, CUDA 12.9, idle)

**Implemented Features:**
- CHAT_SUMMARY.md: Hourly auto-summarization using `composer-1` model (fixed from gemini-2.5-flash)
- `/plan` command: Creates timestamped plan files in `context/plans/`, returns contents and filename
- `/adapt` timeout: Increased to 24 hours (was 10 minutes)
- Summary included in all agent calls for context awareness

**Context Management Research:**
- Issues: Memory rot (unbounded growth, no versioning/compression), fixed-size summaries, full regeneration hourly
- Solutions: Hierarchical memory (short/mid/long-term), progressive compression, incremental updates, staleness detection
- Created `CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT_IMPROVEMENTS.md` with 3-phase implementation plan (low→medium→high risk)
- Plan created: `plan-20260205-135754-reviewing-the-current-context-management-implement.md` for hierarchical memory

**Bot Architecture:**
- Telegram bot, agent loop (5min intervals), commands: /task, /status, /adapt, /cron, /crons, /uncron, /clear, /restart, /kill, /debug, /plan
- `/adapt` can run concurrently but unsafe (no queue/locking, restarts kill other adapts)
- Memory: task-specific (`context/tasks/task-{id}/memory.md`), high-level (`context/tasks/memory.md`), chat (`context/CHAT.md`)

**User Preferences:**
- Summaries: <2000 chars, bullet points, actionable info
- Focus: Memory rot prevention, context management improvements, phased low-risk implementations

**Ongoing Work:**
- Hierarchical memory design (short/medium/long-term tiers) - plan created, implementation pending
